      <h3>Coding for non-techies</h3>
        <p>
          Stackoverflow is overwhelming.<br>Github is a mystery.<br>
          WordPress promises to be easy - but doesn't implement
          the way I want it to.<br>
          How do I become an independent coder?<br>
          This is for you.
        </p>
      <h3>Hello, World!</h3>
        <p class="posts">I've been coding with CodeAcademy for a while now,
        but when I tried to take what I had been learning in the platform
        and practice it on my own, I found myself in an endless loop.</p>
          <ul class="posts">
            <li>I've learned SQL. How can I now analyze COVID-19 data?</li>
            <li>Github is for version control but what is that? How do I use it?</li>
            <li>Why does WordPress look so pretty, cost so much and also be so hard to use?</li>
            <li>How do I create a blog from scratch?</li>
            <li>Who knew there were so many opinions on how to format a logo for your website?</li>
            <li>Why won't my logo change size?</li>
            <li>Why aren't my css changes showing on my site?</li>
            <li>What direction do I want all this to go?</li>
            <li>How can I show my work if I hate doing web design?</li>
          </ul>
            <p class="posts">I also found lots of advice out there:</p>
          <ul class="posts">
            <li>Make a portfolio</li>
            <li>Create a repo on GitHub</li>
            <li>Make a technical blog</li>
            <li>How do I make my work readable on a phone?</li>
          </ul>
        <p class="posts">All of which is great advice: but not achievable (or intelligible!) for someone who is just starting out.
        I figured I would do this: I'm going to blog each step of my learning. I'm going to post my unfiltered
        questions. As I answer them, I'll put them in new posts. I'll also share what programs I've done, in the hopes
        of helping others along the way. I won't post anything in a form that I haven't learned how
        to do myself, meaning this site is going to look very 1996 for a while.
        If I upgrade it later, I'll be sure to post screen shots of where we started. <br>
        Thanks for joining me.
        </p>
      <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p class="posts">I'm a rabbi, an investment banker, and a change maker. I'm living through COVID-19 and I got tired
        of knitting, baking and playstation. I decided I wanted to learn how to wrangle data and build things.
        I got hooked.
        </p>
      <h3>What is codeRav?</h3>
        <p class="posts">Rav is the Hebrew term for Rabbi, and the capitalization is a nod to CamelCase,
        which I only learned was a formal thing when learning JavaScript. With my training,
        a lot of the projects I want to build are based on Jewish text and community, so it
        made sense to incorporate that part of me in the name of the blog.</p>
